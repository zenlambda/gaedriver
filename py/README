gaedriver is a tool to automate end-to-end test for App Engine apps.


MOTIVATION
==========
Before you can run an end-to-end test, you need to bring up your test
environment. For App Engine apps, this means starting dev_appserver or
deploying an application. The gaedriver package allows you to do those
things with an API.


Current status
